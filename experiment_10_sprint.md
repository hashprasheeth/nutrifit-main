### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Food items table
CREATE TABLE food_items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    calories_per_100g FLOAT NOT NULL,
    protein_per_100g FLOAT NOT NULL,
    carbs_per_100g FLOAT NOT NULL,
    fat_per_100g FLOAT NOT NULL,
    fiber_per_100g FLOAT,
    sugar_per_100g FLOAT,
    source VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User food entries table
CREATE TABLE food_entries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    food_item_id INTEGER,
    custom_food_name VARCHAR(100),
    amount FLOAT NOT NULL,
    unit VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    meal_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    calories FLOAT NOT NULL,
    protein FLOAT NOT NULL,
    carbs FLOAT NOT NULL,
    fat FLOAT NOT NULL,
    entry_date DATE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (food_item_id) REFERENCES food_items(id)
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_food_items_name ON food_items(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_food_entries_user_date ON food_entries(user_id, entry_date);
```

### API Endpoints
```python
# Food search endpoint
@app.route('/api/food/search', methods=['GET'])
def search_food():
    query = request.args.get('query', '')
    limit = request.args.get('limit', 10, type=int)
    
    # Perform search using database index and fuzzy matching
    results = db.session.query(FoodItem).\
        filter(FoodItem.name.ilike(f'%{query}%')).\
        limit(limit).all()
    
    return jsonify([item.to_dict() for item in results])

# Food entry creation endpoint
@app.route('/api/food/entry', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def add_food_entry():
    data = request.json
    
    # Create new food entry
    entry = FoodEntry(
        user_id=current_user.id,
        food_item_id=data.get('food_item_id'),
        custom_food_name=data.get('custom_food_name'),
        amount=data.get('amount'),
        unit=data.get('unit'),
        meal_type=data.get('meal_type'),
        calories=data.get('calories'),
        protein=data.get('protein'),
        carbs=data.get('carbs'),
        fat=data.get('fat'),
        entry_date=data.get('entry_date', date.today())
    )
    
    db.session.add(entry)
    db.session.commit()
    
    return jsonify({"success": True, "entry_id": entry.id})
```

### UI Component Specifications

#### Food Search Component
- Autocomplete dropdown appears after 2 characters
- Search results include food name and basic calorie information
- Clicking result populates food entry form
- Recent searches saved in browser storage

#### Portion Size Adjustment
- Slider for quick adjustment with common portion sizes
- Manual input field for precise values
- Unit conversion (grams, ounces, cups) with automatic nutrition recalculation
- Visual portion size reference images

#### Daily Summary Dashboard
- Circular progress indicators for calories and macros
- Color-coded status (red: under, green: on target, yellow: over)
- Time-of-day breakdown of calorie consumption
- Macronutrient ratio visualization (pie chart)

## Performance Considerations

### Search Optimization
- Implement server-side caching for common food searches
- Use trigram-based fuzzy search for better matches
- Pre-compute common misspellings and alternatives
- Batch loading of search results (pagination)

### Data Loading
- Lazy loading of nutrition details until needed
- Preload user's recently used food items
- Cache daily summary calculations
- Use optimistic UI updates for entry creation

## Integration Testing Plan

### Test Scenarios
1. **Food Search Accuracy**
   - Search for common foods ("apple", "chicken breast")
   - Test partial word searches ("chick" for chicken)
   - Verify nutrition data accuracy against known values

2. **Food Entry Workflow**
   - Add food entry from search results
   - Create custom food entry
   - Edit existing entry
   - Delete entry and verify summary updates

3. **Daily Summary Calculations**
   - Verify macronutrient totals match sum of individual entries
   - Test calculation with different units and portion sizes
   - Verify goal progress percentages are accurate

## Deployment Checklist
- Database migration script tested
- Food database initial import verified
- API rate limiting implemented
- Input validation and sanitization
- Frontend bundle optimized
- Search performance metrics captured

## Sprint Transition and Workflow

### Experiment 9 to Experiment 10 Transition Recap
The team successfully integrated the user profile components from Experiment 9:
1. User nutrition targets from profile system now inform the daily goals in food tracking ✅
2. BMR calculation algorithms used to validate calorie intake reasonability ✅
3. Database schema integration between profile and food entry tables completed without issues ✅

### Experiment 10 to Experiment 11 Transition

#### Deliverables for Next Sprint
The following outputs from Experiment 10 will serve as inputs for Experiment 11:
1. **Food Tracking Interface**: Will be extended to include water tracking functionality
2. **Daily Summary Dashboard**: Will be expanded to include hydration tracking
3. **User Data Structure**: Ready for integration with authentication system

#### Handover Process
1. **Code Repository**:
   - All food tracking code merged to development branch
   - API documentation updated with all food tracking endpoints
   - Frontend components fully tested and responsive on all devices

2. **Knowledge Transfer**:
   - Demo session scheduled for Experiment 11 team on day 1
   - Code walkthrough of key components completed with developers
   - Performance optimization documentation shared

3. **Dependencies and Prerequisites**:
   - Food tracking system must be complete before water tracking integration
   - Authentication system design must take into account existing user data flow
   - Database consistency between food entries and profiles must be maintained

#### Key Integration Points
1. The water tracking UI will follow the same design patterns as food tracking
2. User authentication will protect both profile and nutrition data
3. Daily dashboard will combine food and water tracking in a unified interface
